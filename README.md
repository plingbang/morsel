# Morsel

Guess the word written in Morse code.

[**Play here!**](https://plingbang.github.io/morsel/)

Although this is meant to be a joke, I tried to make the game playable by changing the rules a little.

The code was based on reactle (now gone) by [cwackerfuss](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/).

The dictionary is based on [hello-wordl](https://github.com/lynn/hello-wordl) dictionary and [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosigns_for_Morse_code).
